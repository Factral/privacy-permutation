In the era of cloud computing and data-driven applications, preserving privacy in deep learning systems has become a critical concern. Existing methods for privacy preservation rely on image encryption or perceptual transformation approaches. However, they often suffer from reduced task performance, high computational cost or require key management. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Privacy-Preserving framework that uses a set of deformable convolutions for secure task learning. Our method utilizes permuted images to generate visually protected data, which are then fed into a well-known network enhanced with deformable convolutions. By utilizing our approach, users can achieve equivalent performance to plain images without additional training using a secret key, or a considerable level of performance without the key. Moreover, our method enables robust data augmentation in the encrypted domain and access control. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing its potential in cloud-based scenarios and privacy-sensitive applications.
